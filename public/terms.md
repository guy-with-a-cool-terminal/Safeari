# Terms and Conditions

Welcome to Safeari. By using our service, you agree to these Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully.

## 1. About Safeari

Safeari is a DNS-based internet filtering and parental control platform. We provide tools that help families manage and monitor internet access through DNS filtering technology.

**Important**: Safeari is built on open-source principles and integrates with NextDNS via their API, a third-party DNS service provider. We do not operate proprietary blocking technology. Instead, we provide a user-friendly interface to configure and manage DNS-based filtering through established open-source standards and NextDNS infrastructure.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

By creating an account and using Safeari, you agree to:
- These Terms and Conditions
- Our Privacy Policy
- The terms of service of NextDNS (our DNS infrastructure provider)

If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our service.

## 3. Account Registration and Security

**Eligibility**: You must be at least 18 years old to create a Safeari account. By registering, you confirm that you are legally able to enter into this agreement.

**Account Security**: You are responsible for:
